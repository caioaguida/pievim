# pievim: (Proto)Indo-European Mappings for Vim

## Introduction

Some rather basic mappings for typing Indo-European languages and PIE reconstructions on Vim.
Most of the modes written so far were specially designed to work in a QWERTY keyboard.

So far, the mappings cover:
 - Proto-Indo-European (pie)
 - Armenian Script (armenian)
 - Avestan: 
     - Script (avestan-script) 
     - Transliterated (avestan-trans)
 <!-- - Old Church Slavonic Glagolitic (glagolitic) -->
 - Oscan Script (oscan)
 <!-- - Old Persian Cuneiform (old-persian) -->
 - Vedic: Harvard-Kyoto transliteration to IAST (vedic-hk)
 <!-- - Gothic (gothic) -->
 - Greek:
    - Polytonic Greek (polytonicgreek)
    <!-- Mycenaean Linear B Script (linearb) -->
    <!-- Cypriot Syllabary (cypriot) -->
